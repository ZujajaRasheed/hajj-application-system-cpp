# hajj-application-system-cpp
A console-based Hajj management system implemented in C++ using object-oriented programming principles.


Project Overview

This project simulates a basic Hajj management system that allows pilgrims to register, manage their travel arrangements, and group allocations. It's designed as a command-line application with a structured, modular approach using classes and inheritance.

 Features
- Pilgrim registration and information storage
- Group assignment logic
- Travel management (flight info, schedule)
- Console menu-driven interface
- Separate header and source files for maintainability

 Technologies Used
- C++
- Object-Oriented Programming (Classes, Inheritance, etc.)
- Dev C++ / VS Code (for development)

How to Run
1. Open the project in any C++ IDE (e.g., Dev C++, Visual Studio, Code::Blocks).
2. Make sure all `.cpp` and `.h` files are in the same folder.
3. Compile and run the `main.cpp` file.

 File Structure
- `main.cpp` ‚Äì Entry point of the application
- `pilgrim.h` ‚Äì Header file with class declarations
- `pilgrim.cpp` ‚Äì Source file with class implementations
